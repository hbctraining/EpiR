## Additional Lessons
Below we have listed a few extra lessons for you to peruse through. These are detailed lessons that utilize the same data set used in the workshop. We encourage you take a look as they cover some concepts that **can enhance your understanding of programming in R**. 

* [The %in% operator](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/08_identifying-matching-elements.html)
       <details>
         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
           <br>Very often you will have to compare two vectors to figure out if, and which, values are common between them. The <code>%in%</code> operator can be used for this purpose.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Implementing the <code>%in%</code> operator to evaluate two vectors<br>
             - Distinguishing <code>%in%</code> from <code>==</code> and other logical operators<br>
             - Using <code>any()</code> and <code>all()</code> functions<br><br>
         </details>

* [Reordering and matching](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/09_reordering-to-match-datasets.html)
       <details>
         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
           <br>Sometimes you will want to rearrange values within a vector (row names or column names). The <code>match()</code> function can be very powerful for this task.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Maunually rearranging values within a vector<br>
             - Implementing the <code>match()</code> function to automatically rearrange the values within a vector<br><br>
         </details>
         
* [Using custom functions for consistent plots](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/11b_Custom_Functions_ggplot2.html)
      <details>
        <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
          <br>When creating your plots in ggplot2 you may want to have consistent formatting (using <code>theme()</code> functions) across your plots, e.g. if you are generating plots for a manuscript. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Developing a custom function for creating consistently formatted plots<br>
        </details>

* [Writing to file and exporting plots](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/13_exporting_data_and_plots.html)
         <details>
            <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
             <br>Now that you have completed some analysis in R, you will need to eventually export that work out of R/RStudio. R provides lots of flexibility in what and how you export your data and plots.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
                - Exporting your figures from R using a variety of file formats<br>
                - Writing your data from R to a file<br>
          </details>
* [Finding help](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/14_finding_help.html)
         <details>
            <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
             <br>Hopefully, this course has given you the basic tools you need to be successful when using R. However, it would be impossible to cover every aspect of R and you will need to be able to troubleshoot future issues as they arise.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
                - Suggestions for how to best ask for help<br>
                - Where to look for help<br>
          </details>
* [Tidyverse](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/15_tidyverse.html)
         <details>
            <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
             <br>The <a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html">Tidyverse suite of integrated packages</a> are designed to work together to make common data science operations more user friendly. Tidyverse is becoming increasingly prevalent and it is necessary that R users are conversant in the basics of Tidyverse. We have already used two Tidyverse packages in this workshop (<code>ggplot2</code> and <code>purrr</code>) and in this lesson we will learn some key features from a few additional packages that make up Tidyverse. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
                - Usage of pipes for connecting together multiple commands<br>
                - Tibbles for two-dimensional data storage<br>
                - Data wrangling within Tidyverse
          </details>

## Exercises

The key to mastering a skill is through application. In this workshop, we have provided you with the fundamental concepts required to get started in R. We encourage you to **build upon that base through some practical application**. We have created the exercises below, which allow you to play and practice your coding in R. For each set of exercises, we also provide the answer key.
